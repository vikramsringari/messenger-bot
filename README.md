The description of what this bot can do (currently):
I am VikBot. If you want to ask me a question say "Hey VikBot, (your query)". If you want an image search say "Hey VikBot, (your query)" with the key word "image" within your query. If you want to add to my knowledge of answers to questions, say "add: (question you know the answer to) answer: (the answer to the question you added). Once you do this you can just say: "(that question (or any question) that you or anybody has added previously to my knowledge)" at any time to get that specific answer from me. Remember: spelling and spacing matter.
